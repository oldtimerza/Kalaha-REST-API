# Kalaha-backend
This project was started as a solution for a technical assignment given for a Java software engineering position.

Unfortunately although I didn't get the job, I've still decided to continue working on this to improve my code craftsmanship.

If you need to practice as well, or have any suggestions for improvements then please feel free to fork this code or create an issue for any improvements.

Much appreciated :)
